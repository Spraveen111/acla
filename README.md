# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:


## Project Structure
In this project I used 4 components.

1.Header
2.AddTask
3.TaskList
4.EditTask
 
First of all I have utilised functional components and react hooks for building this assignment application. In header section it display the three texts 1.addtask, 2.tasklist 3.edittask. I utilise react router dom and for navigating purpose.By default when we open the application it will be in addtask page show's when the user enters task name and the description and priority after if we click the add button the task name and description priority will be stored in the local storage in the task list I will get the data from local storage and  displayed that data  in list wice.

The data should be displayed like with cheque box so when the user clicks the cheque box the text and description and priority text the overline like mark the text  will be applied And there is a delete button also if the user complete the task if we click the delete button the task should be deleted from the local storage. so when you refresh the deleted task will not displayed in the page.

And has come to the edit task so in that edit task there is a edit button if the user click the edit button it will display to edit task name and description and priority based on the user he can change after if we click the save button it will save in the local storage so we have update reagain for local storage that all the tasks.

And also if the user gives the description more so I utilised css style Overflow property as a value auto so when the description is more we can scroll and we can see that description.

## Styling
I utilized CSS styles.

## State Management
I utilized functional COmponents and react hooks like useState,useEffect.

## Routing
I utilized react router for navigating one page to another page.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
